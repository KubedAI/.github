## Kube-dAI: Empowering Scalable Data and AI Solutions on Kubernetes

Welcome to **Kube-dAI**, an open-source initiative dedicated to providing highly scalable deployment patterns, infrastructure-as-code templates, and best practices for data processing and AI workloads on Kubernetes.

## üöÄ About Kube-dAI

Kube-dAI aims to empower organizations with battle-tested, scalable architectures for running data and AI workloads on Kubernetes, primarily on **AWS Cloud**. Our project offers:

- **End-to-End Deployment Blueprints**: Automated scripts for deploying VPCs and EKS clusters with essential Kubernetes addons on AWS.
- **Best Practices**: Compute, storage, and networking optimization techniques specific to AWS infrastructure.
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks**: Performance evaluation and cost-efficiency analyses on AWS services.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code Templates**: Rapid deployment using Terraform and Helm tailored for AWS.
- **Observability Integration**: Tools for monitoring and logging, including Spark History Server and FluentBit.

Whether you're orchestrating large-scale data processing pipelines or deploying cutting-edge AI models, Kube-dAI provides the insights and tools you need to maximize your Kubernetes infrastructure on AWS.

**Note:** While our initial focus is on AWS Cloud, we intend to extend support to other cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure in the future.

## üîç Project Focus

Our project delves deep into compute and storage best practices for each deployment, covering:

### Data Processing

- **Apache Spark**: Including examples with various storage backends, compute configurations, autoscaling, and schedulers like YuniKorn, Volcano, and Kueue.
- **Spark-RAPIDS**: Accelerate Spark workloads using GPUs.
- **Apache Flink**
- **RayData**
- **Trino** (formerly PrestoSQL)

### Artificial Intelligence

- **KServe**
- **RayServe**
- **RayTrain**
- **NVIDIA Triton Inference Server**
- **Leader Worker Set (LWS)**

For each technology, we provide:

- **Scalable Architecture Designs**
- **Performance Optimization Techniques**
- **Resource Allocation Strategies**
- **Storage Configuration Best Practices**
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks**
- **Observability Solutions**

## üìä Benchmarks and Best Practices

Each repository includes detailed benchmarks and best practices, covering:

- **Scalability Tests**: From gigabytes to petabytes on AWS infrastructure.
- **Throughput and Latency Measurements**
- **Resource Utilization Optimizations**
- **Cost-Efficiency Analyses**
- **Comparative Studies of AWS Storage Solutions**: EBS, EFS, S3, etc.
- **Scheduler Performance**: Evaluations of YuniKorn, Volcano, and KubeQueue.
- **Best Practices for Specific Workload Types**

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Our GitHub organization hosts multiple repositories, each based on a standardized **Factory Repository Template**. This template includes:

- **Docusaurus Documentation Website**: For comprehensive project documentation.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipelines.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Terraform and Helm configurations tailored for AWS.
- **Standardized Directory Structure**: Ensuring consistency across projects.
