# Kube-dAI: Scalable Data and AI Deployment Patterns on Kubernetes

Welcome to Kube-dAI, an open-source project dedicated to providing highly scalable deployment patterns and infrastructure-as-code templates for data processing and AI workloads on Kubernetes.

## üöÄ About Kube-dAI

Kube-dAI aims to empower organizations with battle-tested, scalable architectures for running data and AI workloads on Kubernetes. Our project offers:

- Highly scalable deployment patterns
- Best practices for compute and storage optimization
- Comprehensive benchmarks for performance evaluation
- Infrastructure-as-code templates for rapid deployment

Whether you're orchestrating large-scale data processing pipelines or deploying cutting-edge AI models, Kube-dAI provides the insights and tools you need to maximize your Kubernetes infrastructure.

## üîç Project Focus

Our project delves deep into compute and storage best practices for each deployment, whether it's data processing or generative AI inference. We cover two main categories:

### Data Processing
- Apache Spark
- Apache Flink
- Trino (formerly PrestoSQL)

### Artificial Intelligence
- KServe
- Ray
- NVIDIA Triton Inference Server
- LWS (Leader Worker Set)

For each technology, we provide:
- Scalable architecture designs
- Performance optimization techniques
- Resource allocation strategies
- Storage configuration best practices
- Comprehensive benchmarks

## üìä Benchmarks and Best Practices

Each repository includes detailed benchmarks and best practices, covering:

- Scalability tests (from gigabytes to petabytes)
- Throughput and latency measurements
- Resource utilization optimizations
- Cost-efficiency analyses
- Comparative studies of storage solutions
- Best practices for specific workload types
